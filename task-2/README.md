# README for YOLOv11 Fine-Tuning on Black-White Body Marker Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary steps to fine-tune YOLOv11 on a dataset labeled as "marker," which focuses on black-white body markers. The following instructions guide you through setting up your environment, ensuring GPU access, installing the necessary libraries, and starting the fine-tuning process with your custom dataset.

## Prerequisites

1. **GPU Access**: Make sure you have a NVIDIA GPU available for training. You can verify GPU access by running the `nvidia-smi` command. This should show details about your GPU's performance and memory usage.

   ```bash
   !nvidia-smi
   ```

   If there are any issues, navigate to `Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator`, select `GPU`, and click `Save`.

2. **Python Environment**: This guide assumes you have Python 3.11 installed along with pip for managing packages.

## Installation

1. **Install YOLOv11 and Dependencies**:
   To install the Ultralytics YOLO library along with required dependencies, run the following command:

   ```bash
   %pip install "ultralytics<=8.3.40" supervision roboflow
   ```

2. **Import and Check YOLOv11 Setup**:
   After installation, import the Ultralytics library and confirm the setup:

   ```python
   import ultralytics
   ultralytics.checks()
   ```

   You should see output detailing your setup, including the version of YOLOv11 and the available resources.

## Dataset Preparation

- Ensure that your dataset is properly organized and located in the `datasets` directory. Update the paths in the training configuration if you choose a different location for your dataset.

## Fine-Tuning YOLOv11

To fine-tune YOLOv11 on your custom dataset, you will need to follow the training procedures specified in the Ultralytics documentation. Generally, this involves specifying the configuration for your dataset, including the number of classes, paths to your training/validation images, and labels.

## Notes
- Make sure to adjust any relevant parameters in your training script based on your specific dataset and training goals.
- Engagement with the Ultralytics and YOLOv11 documentation is encouraged for deeper insights into the model's capabilities and customization options.

## Conclusion
This README outlines the steps necessary to get started with fine-tuning YOLOv11 on your black-white body marker dataset. Ensure you follow each step carefully to set up your environment correctly.
